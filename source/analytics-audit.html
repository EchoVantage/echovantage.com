<h1>Analytics Audit</h1>

<p>
Chances are you're using an off the shelf analytics package to gather data and report metrics about your website's traffic. But are you reporting the right metrics for your business and are you confident that your tool is configured correctly to deliver you accurate results? Our team of experts can help identify and fix problems with your analytics implementation. We'll look at everything from how you're collecting data to which metrics you're tracking and how you're reporting them to help you get the most out of your analytics investment. 
</p>

<p>
Our team of experts will work with you to vett your approach and implementation across the four critical aspects of marketing analytics.

	<div class="content">
		<p>The analytics industry promises that if you have the right metrics, insights will appear. We want that to be true, but it’s not science, where testing supports or challenges our beliefs - it’s science fiction.</p>
		<p>We approach analytics differently. Your insights should drive the metrics you follow.</p>
		<p>Our experts will work with you to understand the challenges your business is facing and the strategies you're using to target your customers. Based on your insights we'll design a set of tailored metrics that will allow you to focus on what's truly important to growing your business without getting caught up in the sea of unimportant trivia.</p>

	<h1 class="hook">The <em>Correct</em> Configuration</h1>
	<div class="content">
		<p>Once you know the right metrics to track it's important to ensure that you're using your tools to deliver those as effectively as possible. Errors in your analytics platform's setup can lead to lost data and inaccurate reports.</p>
		<p>Our team of certified consultants will conduct a comprehensive audit of your tool's configuration and provide you with a prioritized list of issues and instructions on how to address them.</p>

	<h1 class="hook"><em>Clean, Consistent</em> Data</h1>
	<div class="content">
		<p>Whether using free analytics tools or paying for premium services, the data collected and reported isn’t necessarily an accurate representation of reality. Analytics services are only as good as the input data, thus the adage “garbage in, garbage out”.</p>
		<p>Using our proprietary tools we will provide you with a detailed report of problems we discover with your data collection processes. Even small issues with the implementation of your sites analytics tracking code can result in major problems with your final reporting.</p>

<section class="item">
	<h1 class="hook"><em>Accurate</em> External Sources</h1>
	<div class="content">
		<p>Your site relies heavily on third parties to deliver you new visitors and market to your existing customers. If the data you're getting from those sources is incomplete or inaccurate it can have a major impact on your ability to make informed decisions about where to spend your marketing dollars.</p>
		<p>Using our proprietary tools to analyze your sites inbound traffic and other external data sources we can identify sites and vendors who don't seem to be providing you with accurate information about the traffic they are driving.
